# Fast Forward

In the untold chronicles of version control, command **a bash script to leapfrog every commit by 13 days**. Safeguard all code treasures from day one to the most recent, for time may bend, but no commit shall vanish into the digital abyss.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

- Do not write anything to the **out** folder. All modifications should be within the cloned repository within **src**

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- All commit timestamps must be pushed forward by **13 days**.

- **No commits should be lost**. This includes the initial commit, merge commits, etc.

- **The current branch should not change**.

- **Committer name, commiter email, author name, author email, and commit messages** should remain the same.
