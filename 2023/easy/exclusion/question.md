## Task

Within a directory filled with mysterious text files bearing diverse names, your quest is to seek and **separate those untouched by the ungodly "534" pattern**. With your bash script as the wand, conjure a new realm called **out**, where only the unsullied files shall reside. Will you rise to this challenge?

### Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

### Output

- All of the text files which do not match the given pattern with the same content as the original in a directory named **out**
