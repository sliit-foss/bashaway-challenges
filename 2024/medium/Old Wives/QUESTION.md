In a quaint village, where old wives gather to eavesdrop on whispered tales, a task has surfaced. You must set up a Jaeger instance to capture the secrets of a simple Node.js service and ensure that the environment variables JEAGER_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT and JAEGER_QUERY_ENDPOINT are properly configured. The old wives depend on your skill to keep the flow of whispered logs intact.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- The logs from the service must be captured by the Jaeger instance
