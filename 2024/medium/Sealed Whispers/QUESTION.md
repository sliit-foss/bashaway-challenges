Attend, O brave soul, to this spectral tale. In the haunted lands where wraiths whisper and phantoms guard their secrets, a mighty task awaits. Thou must prepare an environment with a Kubernetes cluster, imbued with the arcane powers of Bitnamiâ€™s Sealed Secrets.

With these spectral tools, thou shalt take an ordinary Kubernetes secret and encase it within an ethereal seal, encrypting it against all mortal prying. Apply this sealed whisper to the cluster, ensuring its hidden truths are revealed only to those with the rightful incantation. 

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A local Kubernetes cluster should be running

- Cluster should be set as the current context

- Should be able to encrypt a secret using kubeseal and apply it to the cluster
