Within the hallowed workshop of a master gearsmith, two intricate gear manuscripts were unearthed. The first, inscribed as **gears.js**, details the initial schematics. The second, marked **gears-1719135696714**.js, reveals the refinements and enhancements made to the original.

Your task is to **craft a detailed manuscript (patch file)** that encapsulates the precise alterations made between these two versions. This manuscript must be capable of converting the initial design (gears.js) into the refined version (gears-1719135696714.js) and also allow the reverse transformation to restore the original design.

Employ your expertise to produce this transformative manuscript, ensuring it captures the modifications with precision and can be utilized for future iterations in the gearsmith's legacy.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

- The script must be **less than 100 characters** in length. (Including spaces, newlines, and the shebang line)

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A single patch file named **gearsmith.patch** in a directory named **out** that can be applied to the initial design (gears.js) to produce the refined version (gears-1719135696714.js) and vice versa.
