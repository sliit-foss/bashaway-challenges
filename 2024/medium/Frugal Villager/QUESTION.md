In a humble village, a resourceful farmer needs to save every coin. He decides to plant his own crops instead of buying expensive ones from the market. In this spirit, you must do the same in the realm of technology.

On your Kubernetes homestead, cultivate a service named after a reliable horse, "redis," and let it roam freely in the "bashaway" pasture. Ensure this service can be reached through the village gate at port 6381. Share the steps to achieve this while maintaining the thriftiness and efficiency akin to a frugal villager.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A local Kubernetes cluster should be running

- Cluster should be set as the current context

- A service named "redis" should be running in the "bashaway" namespace exposed at port 6381
