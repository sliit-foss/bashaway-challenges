In an ancient forge, a master blacksmith receives a small Golang script, a raw piece of iron in the world of code. Your task is to transform this script into a finely crafted executable, much like forging a blade from raw metal. Use your expertise to build and shape the script into a functional program, showcasing the artistry and precision of a master coder.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A single executable file named `blade` in a directory named `out`.

- The script must be compiled using Go 1.17.2
