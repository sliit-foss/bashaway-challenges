Hark, noble coder, a tale of valor unfolds before thee. In the vast kingdom of Databasia, a precious MongoDB server must be summoned upon thy local machine, its port numbered 27020. The realm demands that this server be fortified with the armor of TLS connections, shielding it from the nefarious threats lurking in the shadows.

To achieve this, thou must inscribe within the sacred environment variables MONGO_TLS_CA_FILE_PATH and MONGO_TLS_CERT_KEY_PATH the paths to the revered TLS certificate authority file and a certificate key file, respectively. Take up this quest with the utmost precision, ensuring the sanctity and security of the server remains unbreached. The kingdom's trust lies in thy skilled hands.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A mongodb server must be running on port 27020 with TLS enabled and connections to it must succeed.
