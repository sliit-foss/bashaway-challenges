In a land where sacred paths crossed the realm of legends, a relic known as the Guiding Token was whispered among those who journeyed far and wide. To prove your worth, summon forth a v4 UUID, an emblem of singularity, and reveal it to the world in your console. Let your script be the key that unlocks this ancient token.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

- The script must be **less than 10 characters** in length. (Including spaces, newlines, and the shebang line)


## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- The script must output a v4 UUID in the format `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` where each `x` is a random hexadecimal digit from 0-9 and a-f, and `y` is a random hexadecimal digit from 8-b.
