In the serene gardens of ancient Japan, a skilled wordsmith faces a formidable task. Given a lengthy scroll of text, they must display it on the console, ensuring each line does not exceed n characters. With careful precision, the wordsmith transforms the unwieldy script into a graceful presentation, honoring the art of clarity and restraint.

## Example Invokation

```bash
bash execute.sh <very long text> <n>
```

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

- The script must be **less than 75 characters** in length. (Including spaces, newlines, and the shebang line)

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- That which is asked in the description.

- The script should not crash if no input is provided.
