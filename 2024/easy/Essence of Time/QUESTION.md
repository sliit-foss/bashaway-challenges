In the halls where time’s flow is neither linear nor certain, a Chronomancer receives a timestamp etched in ISO code. Their duty: to transform it into the raw, unending count of seconds—the epoch timestamp. The clock ticks, but the path from moment to eternity is obscured, known only to those who truly grasp the essence of time.

## Example Invokation

```bash
bash execute.sh 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- The script must output the epoch timestamp of the given ISO timestamp.

- The script should not crash if no input is provided.
