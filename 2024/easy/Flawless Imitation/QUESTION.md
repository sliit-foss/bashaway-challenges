In a shadowy realm of mimicry and imitation, where the Copycat thrives, a peculiar task lies dormant. Located within the src directory lies a scattered collection of .js files, tucked away in various corners and depths. The Copycat, known for its cunning ability to replicate, must append the suffix _clone to each of these files and mirror them perfectly into the out directory, maintaining the original layout.

With each copied file, the Copycat’s legacy grows, leaving behind a trail of near-perfect replicas. Yet, this task requires more than simple mimicry—it demands precision, for even the slightest misstep could break the chain of flawless imitation.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A replica of the src directory structure must be created within the out directory, with each .js file suffixed with _clone.
