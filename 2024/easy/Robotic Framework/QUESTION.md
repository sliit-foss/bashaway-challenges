In a cutting-edge facility, a robotic system is tasked with generating random numbers every second and logging them into a designated file. Design a cronjob script that fulfills this directive, ensuring precise execution of timing and randomness while demonstrating your expertise in automated data management within this robotic framework

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.


## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A random number should be written to a file at path **./out/numbers.txt** every second
