You are tasked with Operation Renard, a covert mission set in wartime France. Your objective is to **decode encoded messages** stored in **codes.txt**, each line containing multiple base64-encoded strings. **Save** the decoded **plaintext** to **decoded.txt in the out directory**. Craft a script that embodies the meticulousness and secrecy required in espionage operations.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A single file named **decoded.txt** should be created in the **out** directory where each line contains the decoded plaintext of the corresponding line in **codes.txt**.
