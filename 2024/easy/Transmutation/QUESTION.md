Hark, thou art beset with a most perplexing riddle. Given thee is a string, a curious concoction of characters. Thy quest, noble scribe, is to transmute this string into a guise befitting the visage of a browser's address bar. As the alchemist transmutes lead to gold, so must thou render this string into its encoded form. Prithee, employ thy wit and wisdom in this arcane endeavor, for the solution lies veiled in layers of digital mystique, awaiting thy keen unraveling.

Example invokation:

```bash
bash execute.sh "Hello, World!"
```

## Output

Hello%2C%20World!
```

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria
