In the ancient Kingdom of Cyberia, the Order of the Secure Cipher protected sacred card numbers processed by the Gateway of Argentum. Given a parchment with these numbers, using Bash, mask all digits except the last four with asterisks. How would you accomplish this?

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A single file named **masked.txt** should be created in a **out** directory which contains the masked card numbers found in **parchment.txt**.
