In a bustling classroom, you are tasked with creating a script that discerns the nature of numbers: **Odd** or **Even**. Your solution should be clear and accessible, ensuring it resonates with young learners curious about the properties of numbers.

## Example Invokation

```bash
bash execute.sh 4
```

## Example Output

```bash
Even
```

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.


## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- The script should output **Odd** if the number is odd and **Even** if the number is even.

- The script should not crash if the number is not provided as an argument.
